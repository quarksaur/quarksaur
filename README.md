## ðŸŒ± About me

Hi! My name is Quarksaur and I'm a 19 years old aspiring full stack developer.<br>
I'm a second-year student in the Coding and Digital Innovation programme of the [Internet and Multimedia Institute](https://www.iim.fr/), in Paris.<br>
Web development is one of my greatest passions. So I'm always trying to expand my expertise and build better apps/experiments.

## <br>ðŸš§ Projects

I'm currently curating many old projects.<br>
Most of them need to be rewritten (while following the original objective), improved, documented or translated.<br>
They will be publicly available as soon as possible.

## <br>ðŸ“Œ Available for hire
I'm currently looking for a **2 to 4 months internship starting April 2025**.<br>
If you're interested in my work, you can always contact me via email or LinkedIn.<br>
I'll be glad to collaborate and discover new technologies in your company.
